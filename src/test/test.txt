Bitcoin Strategist Predicts Rally to $30,000 as Crypto Markets Experience 'Chop'

As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade for around its February monthly open of $23,082, a closely followed crypto strategist believes the king crypto is likely going to surge significantly in the midterm.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa told his 192,400 twitter followers that a burst to the upside is in the cards for Bitcoin, but first, he predicts a dip for BTC.

“BTC: my area of interest is $21,500. Right near the 200-day EMA [exponential moving average] and getting more in the HVN [high volume node] area. Price can still retrace 15% in these conditions and still move higher overall. I still believe we’re going to $30,000 eventually in the midterm.”

High volume nodes (HVNs) are price areas where relatively large amounts of trading volume took place, suggesting periods of consolidation that either act as support or resistance. Should Bitcoin follow Altcoin Sherpa's script, it could decline to the $21,500 price level first before recovering and rallying to $30,000 – suggesting an upside potential of nearly 40% for BTC. 

Meanwhile, another analyst is warning that many traders are currently getting chopped up in the crypto markets. Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Psycho told his 491,200 followers that profits were easy to come by in January with crypto market rallies – but February brought unclear conditions with BTC at nearly the same level as its February open. 

“After almost a full month, BTC is still at the same level as the February monthly open… late bulls and bears alike have been punished by chop." 

Reaction From Crypto Community Divided Over Predictions 
The predictions from Altcoin Sherpa and Altcoin Psycho have sparked divided reactions from cryptocurrency traders and investors on Twitter — with some commenters expressing skepticism while others have expressed excitement over potential gains from Bitcoin's rally. 

One Twitter user commented: “I think we should be cautious here...we saw how quickly things can turn around when bitcoin started dumping last month!”  Another user responded: “The 200-day EMA has proven reliable support for BTC over time — I think this rally could be real!” 

It remains unclear whether Bitcoin will follow either prediction — however many traders will likely be keeping a close eye on BTC's price action as it tries to break through key resistance levels above its current price range of between $22k-$24k over coming weeks.
